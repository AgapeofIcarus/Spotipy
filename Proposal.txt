Project Description/Outline
* We plan to utilize a dataset for Spotify in order to understand what trends we can 
   uncover in the popularity of the songs and artists on Spotify. Ultimately what factors 
    makes a song popular? Is there any correlation between certain factors in a song and 
    whether or not listeners respond to it favorably? 

Research Questions to Answer
* What are the most popular genres and artists? 
* What are the most popular genres and artists for each decade? 
* How are ratings skewed? (i.e. what percentage fall into different ratings)
* What artists by genre (diversity by genre)
* Which artists have the most tracks on Spotify? 
* What's the correlation between popularity and the following:
    * Length of Track
    * Danceability score
    * Explicit
    * Release Date 
    * Artist 
    * Mode
